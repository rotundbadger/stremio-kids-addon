# Kids Content — Stremio Addon

A Stremio addon that provides age-appropriate movie and TV show catalogs for children. Instead of scrolling through an endless mix of content, your kids get curated catalogs organized by age group — all powered by real MPAA and TV Parental Guidelines ratings.

## Install

**[Click here to install in Stremio](https://stremio-kids-addon-ama2.onrender.com/manifest.json)** or paste this URL in Stremio's addon search bar:

```
https://stremio-kids-addon-ama2.onrender.com/manifest.json
```

> The free instance spins down after inactivity. The first request after a cold start may take ~30 seconds.

## What it does

This addon adds **8 catalogs** to Stremio, organized into four age brackets:

| Age Group | Movies | TV Shows | Ratings Allowed |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **0+** | Toddler & preschool films | Shows for the youngest viewers | G / TV-Y |
| **6+** | Family-friendly films | Kids & family shows | G, PG / TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G |
| **9+** | Broader family content | Older kids shows | G, PG / TV-Y through TV-PG |
| **12+** | Pre-teen appropriate | Pre-teen shows | G through PG-13 / TV-Y through TV-14 |

Every catalog supports **genre filtering** (Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy, Music, Documentary), **pagination**, and **search**.

### How filtering works

- Content ratings come from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using official US certification data (MPAA for movies, TV Parental Guidelines for series).
- Only content with an **explicit rating** is included — unrated content is excluded by default, which prevents older films with missing classifications from slipping through.
- The **Horror genre is excluded** across all age groups.
- Catalogs for ages 0+ and 6+ are further restricted to **Animation and Family** genres to keep results focused on genuine children's content.
- Age 9+ expands to include Adventure, Fantasy, and Comedy.
- Age 12+ has no genre restriction since PG-13/TV-14 ratings filter effectively on their own.

### What it doesn't do

This addon provides **catalogs and metadata only**. It does not provide streams — those come from whatever streaming addons you already have installed (Torrentio, etc.). When you click on a title from the Kids Content catalog, Stremio will find available streams from your other addons as usual.

It also **does not block** other content in Stremio. Your existing catalogs and addons remain accessible. This is a limitation of the Stremio addon system — addons can add content but cannot restrict the interface.
